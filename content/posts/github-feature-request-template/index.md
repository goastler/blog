<!-- write a professional article on the following content. Use emojis. Make a short and snappy title for the article, but keep it specific to the content. Always welcome the user first of all. Then tell them what the article is about and why it is helpful to them. Tell them what they'll need in terms of tools and understanding. Tell them how much time they'll follow along. At the end, thank them for reading the article and write a short, snappy summary which encourages them to stay tuned for more great articles. Do not discard any content. Do not reduce any content. Put the output in markdown format. After writing the article, wrap it in a code block.

- a feature request template is needed to fully understand and refine a feature before going ahead with implementation
- it's crucial to identify potential hurdles and contextual consequences of the features
- a feature request template forces the feature to become well-thought-out and finite in specification, making it much easier to implement
- discussion of feature and context is encouraged
- below is a feature template which is a one-size-fits-all solution. The aim is to hit all possible factors which a feature request may need to consider. I expect the majority of repos will not need half of the factors listed, but they're all good to consider.
