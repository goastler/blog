Welcome to the inaugural post of my digital chronicles! Over the past 15 years, I've amassed a treasure trove of solutions to myriad techy problems. These notes, meticulously crafted through countless trials and triumphs, have resided in the humble abodes of text files and markdown on Trello boards.

Speaking of Trello, it has been my steadfast companion in organizing tasks and lists, but alas, its search function leaves much to be desired. It fails to delve beyond card titles, rendering my copious notes buried beneath the surface, particularly within comments – the very essence of my insights and reflections.

Driven by a fervent desire to liberate my notes and share them with the world, I embarked on a quest for a solution that aligned with my ethos of control and accessibility. Enter Hugo – a powerful tool adept at translating markdown into elegantly designed web pages.

My aspirations extend beyond mere organization; I yearn for a platform that not only catalogues my tech escapades but also serves as a canvas for sharing life's eclectic tapestry. From the art of crafting homemade candles with my girlfriend to navigating the intricacies of car repairs and household plumbing, my experiences transcend the realms of technology.

In the days to come, expect a plethora of posts chronicling my adventures, both in the digital domain and beyond. Topics will span from the technical marvel of adding 200TB of storage to my rig to the fascinating journey of leveraging LLMs to distill my notes into a digital doppelgänger.

Join me as I construct this digital haven, where insights and anecdotes converge to form a mosaic of knowledge and inspiration. Together, let's embark on a voyage of discovery, innovation, and shared experiences.

Stay tuned for more updates, musings, and revelations – this is just the beginning of an exciting journey!
